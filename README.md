# BA820_Team11_MLProject
This repo contains our BA820 team project exploring unsupervised machine learning on unstructured data to uncover patterns and clusters without predefined labels.

## Current Direction (as of now)
1. Primary dataset: U.S. Government Grant Opportunities (2004–2023)
2. Secondary dataset (backup): Hollywood Age Gaps in On-Screen Couples

## Grants: What we’re exploring
We’re using clustering and text-based similarity methods to explore questions like:

1. Are there recurring eligibility archetypes (government-only, nonprofit-focused, mixed) and do they differ in funding scale and agency sponsorship?
2. Do distinct time eras of federal grant-making emerge (including shifts around major events like COVID and Ukraine)?
3. Do grant description themes cluster in ways that relate to funding magnitude or cross-agency duplication?
4. Do agencies form distinct funding strategy profiles based on typical award size, number of awards, and eligibility breadth?
