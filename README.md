# BA820_Team11_MLProject

This repo contains our BA820 team project exploring unsupervised machine learning on unstructured data to uncover patterns and clusters without predefined labels.

# Current Direction (as of now)
    Primary dataset: U.S. Government Grant Opportunities (2004–2023)
    Secondary dataset (backup): Hollywood Age Gaps in On-Screen Couples

# Grants: What we’re exploring

We’re using clustering and text-based similarity methods to explore questions like:

Are there recurring eligibility archetypes (government-only, nonprofit-focused, mixed) and do they differ in funding scale and agency sponsorship?

Do distinct time eras of federal grant-making emerge (including shifts around major events like COVID and Ukraine)?

Do grant description themes cluster in ways that relate to funding magnitude or cross-agency duplication?

Do agencies form distinct funding strategy profiles based on typical award size, number of awards, and eligibility breadth?
